## Introduction
NFV-Inspector is a systematic VNF profiling and analysis platform, designed for NFV researchers and engineers.
**Documentation, guides and tutorials are under preparation.**


## Getting Started
**Documentation, guides and tutorials are under preparation.**

## Setup your test environment
In order to install OpenStack, I wrote a complete guide in DOCS folder: https://github.com/michelgokan/nfv-inspector/tree/master/docs/openstack-installation-guide

In order to install/setup Kubernetes, I wrote a complete guide here: https://git.cs.kau.se/michkhan/Kubernetes-Cluster-Installation-Guide (will be publically available soon)

## Install NFV-MON
### Install Elasticsearch and Integrate it with OpenStack
In order to install Elasticsearch I wrote a complete guide in my blog: https://gokan.me/2018/02/18/collectd-elasticsearch-openstack/
### Install NFV-MON Client inside VMs
SSH inside each VM, and run `NFV-MON/nfv-mon-client-install.sh`. It will automatically get installed! To start collectd, use followings command:

  ````
  $ /opt/collectd/sbin/collectd
  ````

## Installation
In order to install each service, simply run `{service}/install.sh`.
